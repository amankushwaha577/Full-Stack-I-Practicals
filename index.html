    <h2><b>About Course</b></h2>
    <p style="font-size: 130%;">
        This course is taught under subject Full Stack Using Scripting Languages. Basically, in this
        course we will came across the technology named as Front End Development which is seriously involved in
        designing the User Interface of the websites using mainly HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS
        (Cascading Style Sheets), Javascript alongwith jQuery, Bootstrap. In this technology, the
        focus of developer is only on the front end (as the name suggests) i.e. face of the website / webpage rather
        than focusing on programming part / database management part which all falls under the backend part. From
        this technology, one can develop starting from a simple webpage of HTML to complex and responsive websites
        which is designed to be accessed via various platform.
