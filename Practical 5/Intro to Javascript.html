            JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level programming language, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It
            has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript
            enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
            use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
            execute it.

            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers,
            usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as
            Electron and Cordova.

            Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective
            standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
